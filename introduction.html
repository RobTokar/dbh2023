    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>David Hyman was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. He acquired his B.A. from Northwestern University, where he studied Theatre with a focus in costume design. During his time at Northwestern, David was heavily immersed in the MFA design curriculum, receiving rigorous graduate-level training as an undergraduate.</p>

    <p>After his time at Northwestern, David stayed in Chicago, working with such companies as Steppenwolf Theatre Company, Victory Gardens Theatre, Writers&rsquo; Theatre, About Face Theatre and others. However, after his experiences designing in New York City, where he now resides, David was drawn to New York's commitment to new and multidisciplinary work.</p>

    <p>David&rsquo;s theatrical background includes training in acting, dance (performance and choreography), directing, devised theatre, properties construction and design, as well as experience in circus arts and puppetry.</p>

    <p>Perhaps due to this diverse background, David approaches his role as a designer as one that cannot exist by itself, believing that success of a production depends entirely on how seamlessly all of its elements not only fit together, but complement one another.</p>

    <p>As a designer, he is interested in costume design as an exploration of a character&rsquo;s psychology - the use of clothing, styling and posture to expose or conceal a character&rsquo;s frame of mind - producing tensions that create a visual subtext. Additionally, he is interested in using costume design as a means of establishing time and place, crafting a cohesive visual world, as well helping to create a dramatic arc for the inhabitants of those worlds.</p>

    <p>While costume design was the primary focus of his studies, David is also interested in set design, puppetry, sculpture, and production design, as well as devised performance, dance, choreography, visual arts and performance art.</p>
